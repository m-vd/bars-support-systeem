BARS or Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scales are scales used to rate performance. This DSS aims to help users with the creation of such scale, as the process is quite complex. 

To use, create roles first. These roles are associated with Critical Incidents which later will have several performance dimensions. Afterwards, rate the performance dimensions using scales. The system will then calculate which performance dimension may be used as an indicator of the role performance.

The inputs should be done by experts in the role or someone who are experienced in it to get a fair judgment.
